         "Think of the volcano as a big mountain. Underground, there is magma. Magma is hot molten rock.",
         
         "In the middle of the mountain, there is a main vent. The magma flows through the vent.",

         When the magma reaches the crater... Poof!""",

         "No. That's the ash. The ash is a gray cloud above the volcano!",
         "Yes! That's correct. Can you now show me the vent of a volcano?",
         
         "No. This is the vent. The vent in in the middle of the volcano.",
         "That's right! What runs through the vent? Can you show me?",
         "No. Remember that lava is molten rock that reached the surface. Underground molten rock is called magma!",
         "Good job! That was a tricky one. Let's clap together for you! Say clap Chani!"
